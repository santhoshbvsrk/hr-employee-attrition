Details about the project, what did you do ? How did you do ? Any other relevant information that would be necessary for evaluators to judge your work.

This project is created as part of Capstone project to help HR advisory to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the Organization. The data was sourced from the HRMS where the details of all the past & current employees were being recorded for the last 15 years. In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employee is likely to quit or not.
